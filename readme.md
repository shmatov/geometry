# Geometry

It's a library for working with 2D geometric shapes implemented in Go.

## Implemented

### Data structures
- `Point2D` - simple two dimensional point
- `Segment` - part of a line bounded by two points
- `Path` - series of points
- `Polygon` - plane bounded figure with optinal holes

### Algorithms
- Point to segment/path/polygon distance
- Point in polygon (ray casting algorithm)
- Nearest polygon (linear search)
- Path simplification (Douglasâ€“Peucker algorithm)
